# Trigger Deployment After Restore

The files have been restored. Now let's deploy:

## 1. Manual Trigger via GitHub UI

Go to: https://github.com/SAMMACKIN/Supply-Chain-App/actions/workflows/supabase-cloud-pipeline.yml

1. Click "Run workflow"
2. Select branch and environment
3. Click "Run workflow" button

## 2. Check Your Secrets

Make sure these secrets exist in your repository:
https://github.com/SAMMACKIN/Supply-Chain-App/settings/secrets/actions

Required secrets:
- SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN
- SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF
- SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD  
- SUPABASE_DEV_PROJECT_REF
- SUPABASE_DEV_DB_PASSWORD

## 3. If It Still Fails

Please share the specific error message from the GitHub Actions log so I can help fix it.

The workflow file (supabase-cloud-pipeline.yml) is configured correctly and should work once the secrets are properly set.

# Supply Chain Logistics App (CSLA) - Implementation TODO

*Generated July 12 2025 - Based on Data model.md, Claude.MD, Call Off Build.md, Transport Order Build.md, and Inventory Lot Build.md*

---

## üöÄ Implementation Overview

This TODO tracks the complete implementation of the Custom Supply & Logistics App (CSLA) to replace the E2open stack. The system manages refined-metal supply chains with 75+ metals, ~300 inbound lots/month, and ~600 customer deliveries via Supabase + React architecture.

**Target Timeline:** Q2-2026 cutover from E2open

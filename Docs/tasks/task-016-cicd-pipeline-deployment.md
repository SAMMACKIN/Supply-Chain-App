# Task 016: DevOps & Deployment - Configure CI/CD Pipeline and Production Deployment

**Status**: 🔴 Pending Approval  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites**: All core features complete (Tasks 012-015)

## 📋 Objective

Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment of the Supply Chain Logistics App to production environment with proper environment management and monitoring.

## 🎯 Scope & Requirements

### CI/CD Pipeline Features Required:
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Automated builds on pull requests
   - TypeScript compilation and linting
   - Automated test execution (unit + E2E)
   - Security scanning and dependency checks

2. **Environment Management**
   - Development environment (existing Supabase project)
   - Staging environment for pre-production testing
   - Production environment with proper security
   - Environment-specific configuration management

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - Supabase Edge Functions deployment
   - Database migration execution
   - Frontend build and hosting deployment
   - Rollback capability for failed deployments

4. **Quality Gates**
   - All tests must pass before deployment
   - Code coverage thresholds enforced
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Performance benchmarking

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Application health checks
   - Error monitoring and reporting
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Uptime monitoring

### Technical Requirements:
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD orchestration
- Supabase CLI for database and function deployments
- Environment variable management
- Semantic versioning and release tagging
- Slack/email notifications for deployments
- Infrastructure as Code (where applicable)

### Security & Compliance:
- Secrets management for API keys
- Access control for production deployments
- Audit logs for all deployments
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- GDPR compliance considerations

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Automated Testing**: All tests run on every PR and merge
- [ ] **Deployment Pipeline**: One-click deployment to staging and production
- [ ] **Environment Isolation**: Separate databases and configurations per environment
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Failed tests or security issues block deployment
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Health checks and error tracking in production
- [ ] **Documentation**: Deployment procedures and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] **Rollback Strategy**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- [ ] **Performance**: Deployment completes in under 10 minutes

## 🔄 Dependencies

**Requires**:
- All core application features completed
- Production Supabase project provisioned
- Domain and hosting infrastructure
- Monitoring and logging services

**Enables**:
- Reliable production deployments
- Automated quality assurance
- Rapid feature releases
- Production monitoring and maintenance

## 🚨 Risks & Considerations

1. **Deployment Failures**: Database migration or function deployment issues
2. **Data Loss**: Production data protection during deployments
3. **Downtime**: Minimizing service interruption during updates
4. **Rollback Complexity**: Quick recovery from problematic releases
5. **Secret Management**: Secure handling of production credentials

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

1. **Pipeline Testing**: CI/CD workflow validation
2. **Deployment Testing**: Staging environment verification
3. **Performance Testing**: Production load and response times
4. **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning and penetration tests
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and restore procedures

# Task 014: Testing & Quality - Cypress E2E Tests for Call-Off Workflow

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Task 012 (Create form), Task 013 (List view)

## 📋 Objective

Create comprehensive end-to-end test suites using Cypress to validate the complete call-off workflow from creation through fulfillment, ensuring reliability and preventing regressions in production deployments.

## 🎯 Scope & Requirements

### Core Test Scenarios Required:
1. **Call-Off Creation Flow**
   - User can select available quota from dropdown
   - Form validation prevents invalid submissions
   - Quota balance validation works correctly
   - Success confirmation and navigation after creation

2. **Call-Off List Management**
   - Data loads correctly with proper pagination
   - Filtering by status, metal, direction works
   - Sorting by columns functions properly
   - Search and date range filters applied correctly

3. **State Transition Workflow**
   - NEW → CONFIRMED transition with validation
   - CONFIRMED → CANCELLED with reason input
   - Bulk operations on multiple call-offs
   - Proper error handling for invalid transitions

4. **Role-Based Access Testing**
   - OPS role can create and manage call-offs
   - TRADE role has appropriate permissions
   - PLANNER role limited to view and fulfill actions
   - Unauthorized actions properly blocked

5. **Data Validation & Error Handling**
   - API error responses displayed to user
   - Network failure scenarios handled gracefully
   - Form validation messages clear and actionable
   - Loading states during API operations

### Technical Requirements:
- Cypress test framework with TypeScript
- API mocking for consistent test data
- Test data fixtures for different scenarios
- Page Object Model for maintainability
- Custom commands for common operations
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Performance & Reliability:
- Tests run in under 5 minutes total
- Parallel execution support
- Retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- Screenshot capture on failures
- Video recording for debugging

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Complete User Flows**: End-to-end scenarios from login to call-off fulfillment
- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tests on tablet and mobile viewports
- [ ] **API Integration**: Real backend integration with test database
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, validation errors, permission denials
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Page load times and API response times
- [ ] **Accessibility Testing**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- [ ] **CI Integration**: Automated test execution on pull requests

## 🔄 Dependencies

**Requires**:
- Task 012: React form implementation
- Task 013: List view implementation  
- Test database with seed data
- User authentication system

**Enables**:
- Production deployment confidence
- Automated regression testing
- Quality assurance processes

## 🚨 Risks & Considerations

1. **Test Data Management**: Consistent test data across environments
2. **API Dependencies**: Real backend integration complexity
3. **Timing Issues**: Async operations and loading states
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser differences
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping tests updated with UI changes

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

1. **Critical Path Coverage**: Core business workflows tested first
2. **Edge Case Validation**: Error conditions and boundary scenarios
3. **Regression Prevention**: All bug fixes include corresponding tests
4. **Performance Monitoring**: API response time assertions
5. **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison for UI consistency
